# Simple-Store

https://k-konstantinidis.github.io/Simple-Store/

This is a very simple version of a web store, without the help of Bootstrap. It has 2 different pages. There is no PHP. 
Also you are not allowed to buy something from the store, you can only see the total cost.

The first page of the website is the Index (Home) page. There you can see the featured products and the welcome to the store message.

The second page is the Store page. There you can choose more than one products from the 3 different categories. After choosing a product, you can choose the amount 
you want to buy. Then if you click the calculate cost button, the total cost will appear next to it.

If you haven't chosen a product, then if you click the button the total cost will be 0.

If you choose an amount of a product, but you hven't checked the checkbox, then the cost of the product will not be calculated to the total cost.
